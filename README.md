Abstract submitted to the [2021 EarthCube Annual Meeting] (https://web.cvent.com/event/6589b2a2-9fd5-4e0b-a214-e0ba1c6348fe/summary).

Water temperatures dominate bonefish (Albula spp.) movements and feeding patterns in coastal flats. 
This notebook will utilize the Pangeo ecosystem tools to visualize Multi-Scale Ultra-High Resolution (MUR) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) grids around the Marls, a popular catch and release angling site, in Abaco, Bahamas. Bonefish angling tournaments and eco-tourism are significant contributors to the local community in the Bahamas. Since bonefish are ectothermic, they are highly sensitive to temperature changes in their environment and respond to these changes. Bonefish rarely occupy areas that exceed their critical temperature 28ÂºC. In addition, little is known about how bonefish will respond to increasing sea temperatures. Studies show that even minor increases in optimal temperature and critical temperature will negate access to feeding areas. This translates to fewer Bonefish migrating into tidal creeks and thus affecting the local economy. This Jupyter Notebook will demonstrate 
the value of reproducible, cloud-based notebooks by analyzing open-access oceanic data with economic value 
to the Bahamian community. The notebook will use tools from the Pangeo ecosystem (xarray, dask, zarr) 
to access the MUR dataset from the AWS public dataset program, subset data to the Marls region, and visualize differences in the sea surface temperature. This notebook can be a valuable asset to the local eco-tourism community providing access to a large public dataset and scientific analysis compatible with their business.
